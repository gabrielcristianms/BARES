# Introduction

This programming project implements a simple parser for an EBNF (_Extended Backus-Naur Form_) grammar.

The first objective is to provide a simple example of EBNF grammar and a parser, so that students may understand the concept.
The second objective is to reuse this code to do the parsing stage in the [BARES programming project](http://projetos.imd.ufrn.br/LP1_20162/bares.git).

Information on **EBNF grammar** may be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backusâ€“Naur_Form).

Information on **recursive descendent parsing** may be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser).

# The Grammar

The gramar we want to parse is for arithmetic expressions representing simple addition of integers.

    <expr>            := <term>,{ "+",<term> };
    <term>            := <integer>;
    <integer>         := 0 | ["-"],<natural_number>;
    <natural_number>  := <digit_excl_zero>,{<digit>};
    <digit_excl_zero> := "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9";
    <digit>           := "0"| <digit_excl_zero>;

This grammar _accepts_ expressions like:

* "23 + 43 + 0   + -124 + 21"
* " 21"
* "-21 +     -18"

And _rejectes_ expressions like:

* "01 + 3"
* " - 3 + 4"
* "2 +"
* "  "
* "+2 + 5"
* "-02 + 4"
* "(2+3)" _(for the time being)_
* "2 - 3" _(for the time being)_

Later on we might want to improve this grammar to accept _subtracion_ and _parenthesis_.

# Log

* Oct-25th:
    - Created class `Parser`, to parse an expression.
    - Created class `ParserResult` (inner class of `Parser`), to represent the result of a parsing operation.
    - Created a simple driver that tries to parse a series of expressions.
    - Created basic processing methods for the class `Parser`.
* Oct-27th:
    - (see [TODO](#todo))

# TODO

- [X] Explain the concepts behind the parsing process.
- [X] Implement `Parser` class and its basic infrastructure for processing symbols.
- [ ] Implement the non-terminal production rules.
- [ ] Test the parsing process.
- [ ] Improve parsing to generate, as a result, a list (`std::vector`) of tokens.
